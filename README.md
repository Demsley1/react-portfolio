  ## Description 

  This is my portfolio I created with columbie engineering boot camp using the create react app. As it is a react app the portfolio is a single page application that changes displays throuh simple dom manipulation. The create react app provides a fairly easy to navigate template with custom methods tat allow handling of different navigational elements a little less painful, which we could all use in the world of web development.
